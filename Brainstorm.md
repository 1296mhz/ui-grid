# Thoughts

> Don't build the 'everything-in-one' solution first. Build a "you must put the components together yourself" approach 
> first. Then create some directives afterwards that simply packages everything together _for_ you.

## Outstanding Problems

* pinned columns performance
* Core performance (multiple grids, grids loading slowly, horizontal scrolling peformance in general)
* Events (many bugs)
* Layout flexibility 

# Desired Functionality

* Pinning columns
* Sorting Columns
* Easy-to-customize templates
* Editing
* Grouping
* Searching / filtering (over whole grid, by column)
* Pagination (with hooks for backend retrieval)
* Row / column selection (both by user and programmatically)
* Column resizing (drag separator to resize, double-click to auto-size)
* Mobile/responsive options? (Column 
 
# Browser Support?
* IE9+, latest FF, Opera and Chrome. (Which safari version? jQuery 2.* goes with 5.1)
 
# Angular Support?
* We should state support up front with each release. Also, one of the things that has come up a lot is issues with unstable releases. We should state whether or not we're going to support unstable angular. Just as a standard. 

## Plugins?
* Column reordering
* Row reordering
* Exporting?

# Declaritive HTML

```html
<div ui-grid>
  <div ui-grid-header>
    <!-- auto-generate column headers if no content supplied? -->
  </html>
  
  <!-- ui-grid-repeat auto-generates columns, ui-repeat-virtual handles the actual virtual repeater functionality? -->
  <div ui-grid-repeat  ui-repeat-virtual="d in data">
    <!-- auto-generate columns if no content supplied? -->
  </div>
  
  <!-- or perhaps this?? (from ProLoser) -->
  <ng-repeat="item in $virtualized" ui-virtualize="items">
  <!--
    ui-virtualize virtualizes a list of items and hands it to the built-in repeater, if the repeater is performant enough
  -->
</div>
```
> We need to do a default rendering anyway, so yes, we would auto-generate column headers and columns. 
We'll have the code to do so in order to do some core demo/default implementation- even if we're successful and can get this thing fully customizable.

## Alternative

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div ui-grid-header scrollsync>
    <!-- auto-generate column headers if no content supplied? -->
  </div>
  
  <div class="grid-body" ui-virtualize="data as $rows" scrollsync ui-pinnable="columns">
    <!-- virtualize creates `$rows` that is passed to ng-repeat -->
    <div ng-repeat="row in $rows">
      
      
      <div ng-repeat="column in row">
        <!-- ability to define custom columns -->
        <!-- ability to virtualize columns too:
        <div ng-repeat="column in $columns" ui-virtualize="row as $columns">
        -->
      </div>
      
      <!-- or pretty much a default template of the above snippet ^^ -->
      <ui-grid-row data="row"></ui-grid-row>
      
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

> I like this.  There are lots of use cases we have to account for if we're going with this pattern, but at least as far as the basics I think it's clear.

```html

<div class="grid">
  <!-- probably a new implementation of sortable or just renamed to ui-reorder, etc -->
  <div ui-grid-header ui-pinnable="data.columns" ui-sortable="data.columns">
    <!-- how to mark-up pinned columns so they align with resepective pinned grid-body below? -->
    <div ng-repeat="column in data.columns">
      {{ column }}
      <!-- Pinning is handled by heading row only, updated $pinnable object reflects changes to body automatically -->
      <a ng-click="$pinnable.pin(column, 'left')">Pin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-body" ui-virtualize="data.rows as $rows">
    <div ng-repeat="row in $rows">
      <!-- ui-pinnable creates a subset of columns -->
      <div ng-repeat="column in $pinnable.unpinned" ui-editable="row[column]">
        {{ row[column] }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
