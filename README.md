##About##
__ng-grid__ Originally built on knockout we wanted to port it to angular.


##Disclaimer##

ng-grid is in beta release currently. We are going to be adding more features here in the very near future...

***
_The sizzle_:

```html
<div ng-controller="ng-grid""></div>
```
```javascript
function ng-grid($scope) {
};

ko.applyBindings(vm);
```
